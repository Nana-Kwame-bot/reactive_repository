# Reactive Repository

This brick is designed to help you to connect your blocs through the domain layer, using the [rxdart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) package in Dart. It provides a reactive repository to keep your blocs' state synchronized. More information about this pattern can be found [Connecting Blocs through Domain](https://bloclibrary.dev/architecture/#connecting-blocs-through-domain) and [Effective Bloc-to-Bloc Communication Strategies in the Domain Layer](https://henryadu.hashnode.dev/effective-bloc-to-bloc-communication-strategies-in-the-domain-layer).

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Reactive Stream Management:** Utilizes [BehaviorSubject](https://pub.dev/documentation/rxdart/latest/rx/BehaviorSubject-class.html) from rxdart to manage a stream of bloc states.

- **Current State Access:** Easily access the current state of your bloc at any point in time.
- **Update Functionality:** Update the state of your bloc with a new one as needed, ideally within the `onChange` callback.


## Getting Started ðŸš€

To use the Reactive Repository brick, you need to have Dart and rxdart package in your environment. If you haven't already, add rxdart to your project's pubspec.yaml under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rxdart: any
```

## Usage ðŸŽ¨

```bash
mason make reactive_repository
```

## Variables âœ¨

| Variable              | Description                 | Default        | Type     |
| -----------------     | --------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| `bloc_state_name`     | The name of the bloc state  | `CounterState` | `string` |
| `includeDispose`      | Include a dispose method    | `true`         | `boolean`|
| `seedBehaviorSubject` | Seed the BehaviorSubject    | `true`         | `boolean`|



## Example Output ðŸ“¦

File `counter_state_repository.dart`

```dart
// Imports the RxDart package for reactive programming support.
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart'; 

class CounterStateRepository {
  // Declares a BehaviorSubject to hold and stream the CounterState. It's seeded with an initial state.
  final BehaviorSubject<CounterState> _counterStateSubject =
      BehaviorSubject<CounterState>.seeded(const CounterState());

  // Exposes the stream of counter state updates for subscription.
  Stream<CounterState> get counterStateStream => _counterStateSubject.stream;

  // Provides synchronous access to the current state of the counter.
  CounterState get currentCounterState => _counterStateSubject.value;

  // Allows for the counter state to be updated, notifying all stream subscribers.
  void updateCounterState(CounterState state) =>
      _counterStateSubject.add(state);

  // Closes the BehaviorSubject stream to prevent memory leaks upon disposal.
  void dispose() => _counterStateSubject.close();
}
```
